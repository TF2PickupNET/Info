## FAQ
 - I want to browse other website when I\'m added up, how do I know when to ready up?
    - <span class="bot">TF2Pickup.net</span> has a wide variety of [announcers](/announcers) available telling you to ready up or if it is time to play. Switch between announcers on your [profile](/profile) and [donate](/donate) for more announcer packs.
 - I have been banned for no reason, what is this?
    - You never get banned for no reason, make sure you have actually read the [rules](/rules) and play pickups with those rules in mind. If you have been banned it will show the reason why you have been banned and who placed the ban. If you have a ban on ETF2L we don't allow you to play here either.
  - How do I get a fancy color in chat, like some of the other users?
    - These users with colored names are mostly <a href="/donate" class="donator">donators</a> or <span class="honorary">honorary</span> users, some of them are TF2Pickup.net <span class="admin">admins</span> or <span class="developer">developers</span>.
 - I need mumble and/or server details, where can I find those?
    - Type <span style="font-family: monospace">!mumble</span> in chat to have a direct connect to the TF2Pickup.net Hangout Mumble channel. Info is also available on your [matchpage](/match) where you will be redirected when the matchmaking has done its magic. The SourceTV connect information can also be found on the matchpages when a pickup is live.
  - What does this pre-ready timer do when I am added up to a pickup?
    - This is a button to mark you as ready to play this pickup for a set amount of time. In this time you can grab a snack, take a toilet break or mentally prepare for the pickup you're about to play.
  - Why is my stream not showing up on TF2Pickup.net?
    - Fill out your Twitch channel name in your [Profile](/profile) and make sure you have been active on TF2Pickup.net recently and that you are streaming Team Fortress 2. Donators who stream Team Fortress 2 are always shown in the list of streaming users when they are live.
  - Why does this player have a pink/purple heart next to his username?
    - This is a TF2Pickup.net Medic-Friendpick&trade; indicator; a medic has picked a player to end up in his/her team. This only works in Highlander and the 6v6 pickup bots.
