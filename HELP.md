## FAQ
 - I want to browse other website when I\'m added up, how do I know when to ready up?
    - <span class="bot">TF2Pickup.net</span> has a wide variety of [announcers](/announcers) available telling you to ready up or if it is time to play. Switch between announcers on your [profile](/profile) and [donate](/donate) for more announcer packs.
 - I have been banned for no reason, what is this?
    - You never get banned for no reason, make sure you have actually read the [rules](/rules) and play pickups with those rules in mind. If you have been banned it will show the reason why you have been banned and who placed the ban. If you have a ban on ETF2L we don't allow you to play here either.
